abstract = {P4 is a high-level language for programming protocol-independent packet processors.
P4 works in conjunction with SDN control protocols like OpenFlow. In its current form,
OpenFlow explicitly specifies protocol headers on which it operates. This set has
grown from 12 to 41 fields in a few years, increasing the complexity of the specification
while still not providing the flexibility to add new headers. In this paper we propose
P4 as a strawman proposal for how OpenFlow should evolve in the future. We have three
goals: (1) Reconfigurability in the field: Programmers should be able to change the
way switches process packets once they are deployed. (2) Protocol independence: Switches
should not be tied to any specific network protocols. (3) Target independence: Programmers
should be able to describe packet-processing functionality independently of the specifics
of the underlying hardware. As an example, we describe how to use P4 to configure
a switch to add a new hierarchical label.},
